Description          "500 hours of hard work!\r\n\r\nALL good mods on Workshop are not only integrated but also significantly improved or largely remade.\r\n\r\nTogether with my unique features which will meet your wishes or go beyond your imagination.\r\n\r\nBehold how powerful a mod can be!\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis mod is a result of my great effort to enhance the game to the fullest.\r\n\r\nIf your PC runs slowly with this full Deluxe, [u]use [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834342553]the Lite version[/url] instead[/u].\r\nAs to non-Steam players, please chat with me and tell me your email address, and I will send you the files.\r\n(Note: [url=http://steamworkshopdownloader.com/view/830937667]the file from Steamwork Shopdown Loader[/url] seems invalid for Windows users; unzip it and you just get many empty folders. On Mac, however, it can be unpacked correctly with unarchiver. )\r\n\r\nIf you are Chinese, [u]use [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=821415114]{中文豪华版}[/url] instead[/u]!\r\n\r\nAnd here's a map: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=839919367]{All-in-One Deluxe} Sample[/url].\r\n\r\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n	[*]Corrected many mistakes and errors in texts, images and configurations.\r\n	[*]A lot of helpful information was added as tooltips. Many mysteries are revealed for you. So, you will no longer guess blindly or be misled by rumors around forums.\r\n	[*]UI redesigned. I modified the layouts and elements of dialogues, especially Main Menu, Reports and Rapsheet tabs.\r\n	[*]Room and need complaint icons are now in a modern style.\r\n	[*]Many tweaks about materials, objects, grants, need providers. Made the game more realistic, reasonable and balanced.\r\n	[*]Except very, very few ones, you will not need any more mod on Workshop. Everything is here. And better.\r\n	[*]New tools, items, staffs and mechanics. I wrote nearly 10,000 lines of Lua script code.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]INSTALL[/h1]\r\n\r\nSubscribe this mod.\r\n\r\nIn the game, go to [Main Menu > Extras > Mods]. Check (the box to the right of) this mod and Apply.\r\n\r\nIf you don't see this mod in the list, wait for its download (at background) and try later.\r\n\r\n[h1]WARNING[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod might cause crashes (I am not sure if, when and why). [b]Save often![/b]\r\n\r\nDon't bother me with anything about conflicts with other mods.\r\n\r\n[h1]LANGUAGES[/h1]\r\n\r\n[list][b][i]Done[/i][/b]\r\n	[*] (Default) English by me\r\n	[*] Italian by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025806811]futuroattore86[/url]\r\n	[*] Russian by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrlasgame]Las ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list][b][i]In progress[/i][/b]\r\n	[*] Spanish by Gero Giovenale and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dapunn/]DaPunn[/url]\r\n	[*] Swedish by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/clwo/]Nightmar3[/url]\r\n	[*] Dutch and German by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988873561][TDS]Double8Barrel[/url]\r\n	[*] German by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/teros1/]Teros[/url]\r\n	[*] Dutch by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TZTOM/]peanutbutter yelybean[/url]\r\n	[*] French by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/devckuw/]devckuw[/url]\r\n	[*] Greek by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouMadBrom/]Paranoid[/url]\r\n	[*] Portuguese (Brazil) by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968308439]Predatorian[/url]\r\n	[*] Polish by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/klubek]klbk[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nContact me if you volunteer to help to translate. I have a gift for you to do it very easily.\r\n\r\n[h1]KEY FEATURES[/h1]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n	[*]Many items (objects) used to have problems about orientation. Fixed or improved.\r\n	[*]You can easily select a room and clone or move it. Several modes of cloning are at your service. You can also move or rotate objects.\r\n	[*]Heard a sound of misconduct but failed to find who had done it? Now, when a prisoner just misbehaved, there will be a large red marker above him.\r\n	[*]No room requires being indoors. You can freely plan your prison before dealing with the messy building of foundation, walls and doors.\r\n	[*]Configurations of rooms are redesigned.\r\n	[*]Better and more grants. Grants can serve really well as guidance for players. Moreover, you will value low Reoffending Rate and minimal guards. You can discover more fun when taking these challenges.\r\n	[*]The dev team wanted players to reform prisoner and release them with low Reoffending Rate. Sadly, I don't think players get it. Now, you can see Reoffending Chance of each prisoner in their tooltip. And you Warden can generate rewarding bonus for the decrease of this index.\r\n	[*]Waiting for dawn is a waste of time? You can enable Faster Sleep Time in the menu of your Warden. But sadly, Cheats mode must be enabled first.\r\n	[*]Also in Cheats mode, your Foreman can change floors (materials of terrain) of many tiles at one click. The ranges include 1) Borders, 2) Grids (every 10 meters) and 3) the rest tiles which are outdoors and not in rooms.\r\n	[*]Half of items in the Bureaucracy window are repositioned.\r\n	[*]If you feel bored by a successful yet peaceful prison, try the reform program Dangerous Meeting and the mechanic of Guard Corruption. Both will irritate prisoners and cause fights.\r\n	[*]Food policy and exercising on Weights Bench influence the health of prisoners. Unhealthiness will cause random damage.\r\n	[*]Doctors are far busier. Healing costs money. Therefore, injures are not trivial issues.\r\n	[*]Medicine Cabinets can provide first aids and call doctors if needed.\r\n	[*]Workshop is a mess. I improved the configurations a little and gave you clear helpful tips. But that's all. As a compensation, I added a new line of education and labor about Bookkeeping. And thus your accountant is more useful.\r\n	[*]Lawyers can earn money from visitors for prisoners. So visitation is still good for you even when Phone Booths can easily satisfy Family needs.\r\n	[*]You can upgrade CCTV cameras to sort prisoners if they are snitchers or gang members. Murders and fights will drop thereafter.\r\n	[*]Drinking Machines can replenish energy of staffs.\r\n	[*]You can Muster Guards when prisoners are tough to put down.\r\n	[*]Oh, and one more thing. You really should play the Hitman: Agent 48 mini games (you need research and hire him) where you control a hitman to assassinate or rescue a target prisoner.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]HELP ME[/h1]\r\n\r\nPlease let more players to know this mod. You can...\r\n[list]\r\n	[*]Rate it on Steam Workshop\r\n	[*]Mention it in your review\r\n	[*]Or any way you are good at. (i.e., make a YouTube video?)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]DISCLAIMER[/h1]\r\n\r\nI'm Chinese. Please excuse my English if there are mistakes.\r\n\r\nThere is a very long list of all the mods which I integrated or learnt from. You can find it as data/THANKS.txt in the folder of this mod, since this description is already too long and close to Steam's limit.\r\n\r\nGrateful as I am, I want to emphasize that I never simply copy-and-pasted their works; I always tried to make far better ones based on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
