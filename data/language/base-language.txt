codex_option_staffneeds Staff Needs
codex_tooltip_staffneeds Your security staff have some needs similar to those of prisoners. You must install facilities in Staff Rooms or Staff-Only rooms to satisfy them.\nHappy or unhappy staff will have different efficiency in their jobs and influence upon prisoners.\nFor example, a very pissed-off guard will have as low as 10% success rate when searching a dangerous gang member.\nOr worse, they may take bribes instead of confiscate contrabands. (Though you will never see...)\nAnd guards may even beat prisoners to death to vent their anger.

# ` Enable needs for your Guards, meaning they will need to be able have their needs taken care of for them to be able to do their jobs properly.

object_TimeWarpNeedModifier Needs Modifier for Faster Sleep Time
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_TimeWarpNeedModifier This is a patch. When Time is sped up by FST, it just makes the clock go faster but has no effect on prisoners' needs. Prisoners won't satisfy Sleep and Comfort enough while other needs won't grow much. So, I have to create this modifier, one at every bed to affect all prisoners.\nThey are created when the sleep time range starts and removed when it ends.\nOnly when you have enabled Cheats (more precisely, its ImmediateObjects feature) can this patch work well.\nIf you are curious, place a modifier and see how powerful it is.\nObviously, you should never use it for real.

Good for doctors (unwilling to go out) and prisoners (don't bother to come if wound is minor).\nTimely treatment can increase the score of Health in prisoner Grading.\n\nIf there remains some wound, it can call a doctor.\n\nIf you have several Infirmaries, you can enable "This is an Infirmary". If there has been no doctor for an hour, it will call one.

reformprogram_Bookkeeping [Production] Bookkeeping
reformprogram_Bookkeeping_text The simplest of accounting outsourcing services. Extremely dull and exhausting. Very suitable for prisoners who can at least do some math, isn't it?\n\nSince few can be qualified and fewer have interest in it, this program is mandatory.\nPrisoners who pass this training can work in Accounting Room.\n\nI designed this program to give [Academic] Foundation Education Program more value; allow you to earn good money besides the chaotic Workshop product lines; and you Accountant will no longer idle all day.

buildtoolbar_popup_staff_SwapOffice Make two administrative staff swap their offices.\n\nNot used often. But when you need it, it is really helpful.\n\nSince I have make sure all administrative staff of some use, you should place their offices wisely.\n\nNow, you can reassign offices by swapping.\n[STEPS]\n1) Use this to mark one administrative staff, creating a blue marker above him.\n2) Then use this to select the other staff for swapping.\n   However, the names of the offices don't change.\n3) Wait for the two staff to arrive their new offices.\n4) Clear the two office rooms and rebuild them.\n   Now, everything is fine.

research_Hitman Hitman
researchtooltip_Hitman Our company has a precious opportunity to co-operate with a conglomerate of hitmen known as the "ICA" and turn your prison into a perfect stage for drill of such professional arts.\nEnables you to play several mini games in completely different ways, and therefore experience your prison in some brand-new aspects.\n\nSome keywords as a teaser: Piano Wire, disguise, stealing, poisoning, explosion and escape.\n\n"Hire" a "Agent 48" in Staff menu to start a mission.

object_Avatar Agent 48
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_Avatar [New Mechanic]\nAn apprentice named "after" a very famous legend.\nAlso bald. But likes old-school appearance when not working.\nCan easily infiltrate restricted areas for covert missions.\nAn artist mastering a variety of lethal and non-lethal approaches.\n\nYou control him with WSAD to walk; combined with Shift, to run.\nThe first prisoner he touches will be marked as his target.\nClick him and choose a type of mission. Follow the steps as instructed.\n\nWhen he is near to certain facilities (objects), there can be something to steal.\nTo lower rate of exposure, however, you should avoid witnesses like prisoners, staff and CCTV cameras.\n\nIn most steps, you can disguise. (You may think it is too easy and handy. I simplified this to encourage you to try different disguises.)\n\nOf course, you cannot "hire" more than one Agent 48.\nReminder: Save the game first!

buildtoolbar_popup_help_Avatar_1 You have no idea about what this pay homage to?\nYou should learn about Hitman series and their hero Agent 47.\n\nThese mini games are the best example of my enthusiasm for and study on modding.\nI believe you will have more fun than the official yet shoddy Escape Mode.

a48__at__target_dead \nTarget is dead.\n\nThe only thing you can do is abort the mission.
a48__at__need_disguise Must disguise first



a48__menu__action_Backstab Backstab Target (Success Rate: *R%)
a48__at__desc_backstab_1 You already carry a Piano Wire when you are sent here.\nBut you'd better change for a more powerful weapon at Kitchen or Workshop.\nFirstly, click 48 to open context menu.\n\nWeapon power: Piano Wire < Knife < Shank\n\nSometimes you cannot avoid witnesses completely, so you need to disguise properly elsewhere.\nDisguising can be exposed, too.\nIf exposed, well, you just get fined. So feel free to try different disguises.

a48__at__desc_backstab_2 Make a critical hit and kill the target from behind when no one is looking.\nBe aware of your target's orientation.
a48__at__desc_backstab_3 The target tries to resist in vain.\n\nNote: I cannot make people draw their weapons.\nJust ignore this unreality.
a48__reward__backstab \nYou got rid of the target under the radar.



a48__at__desc_scuffle_2 When enough prisoners are around you and your target, you can spark a scuffle.\n\nYou will automatically lure Armed Guards to draw Shotguns.\n\nWith some luck, your target can be beaten to unconsciousness. And you will make sure him bleed to death and accomplish the mission.
a48__at__desc_scuffle_3 Get out of the scuffle. Just wait for your target to be injured.\n\nYou can arouse more prisoners if you like.
a48__reward__scuffle \nWhat a tragic incident. But not uncommon in prison, isn't it?\nYou killed the target in a backhanded way and no one suspected you.

a48__at__desc_fire_1 Go and get what you need for making a Flammable Uniform.\nAfter that, let the target change into it. Then ignite it.\nOf course you will set fire to the prison as a result.\nMaybe you should do something as a precaution before you continue this mission.

a48__at__desc_fire_3 You refined Flammable and get something smelling like Bleach.\nNext, you should smear a Prisoner Uniform with it.
a48__at__desc_fire_4 Place this unique Uniform on the bed of the target.\nHe will change into it when he comes back.
a48__at__desc_fire_5 Wait for the target to go back to cell and accept your present.\nHe will feel a little awful about the smell of Bleach but won't have any idea about danger.
a48__at__desc_fire_6 Find a good place. There, your Lighter will help the target to be a man "on fire", literally.
a48__at__desc_fire_7 Enjoy the show.

a48__at__desc_grenade_1 Go and get what you need for making a Grenade.\n\nThen throw it at the target. And BOOM!\n\nThis explosion won't cause lasting fire.\n\nYour such loud and shocking act will lead all guards come after you.\nFind a place quickly to disguise and end the pursuit.
a48__at__desc_grenade_2 Your success in improvising a powerful grenade with these simple materials proved your ingenuity.\n\nThe explosion will range 3.5 meters.\nThe target will be killed "in a flash", literally.\nBut you must prepare for the pursuit of many guards.\nThink where to hide and disguise before you act.
a48__at__desc_grenade_3 Avoid the sights of guards and disguise.\nYou will be safe then.

a48__at__desc_playdead_1 How to let a guard escort the target out through the main gate?\nWell, go and get some Medicine.\nThen arouse a scuffle and let the target "die" in the middle.\nOnce the body of the target reaches a Hearse, his soul will awaken and say farewell to the prison.
a48__at__desc_playdead_2 A potion has been created.\nGive it to the target.



a48__at__desc_playdead_3 Spark a scuffle which can involve the target.\n(Just like the steps of Scuffle mission)\nThe target will play dead and fall into a deathlike coma, or something very similar.\nGuards will not know, anyway.\nThe rest will depend on the acting and luck of the target.
a48__at__desc_playdead_4 When enough prisoners are around you and your target, you can spark a scuffle.\n\nYou will induce Armed Guards to draw Shotguns.\n\nWith some luck, your target can be beaten to unconsciousness and eventually bleed to death. Well, a fake one.
a48__at__desc_playdead_5 Get out of the scuffle. Just wait for your target to be injured.\n\nYou can arouse more prisoners.

object_Explosion Explosion




a48__at__desc_outbreak_1 A suborned truck drive can bring you bombs.\n\nImport three bombs and explode them at proper positions.\nMany prisoners will respond with a massive escape.\nGuards will be too busy to pay special attention to your target, who can fish (or be a fish?) in troubled waters.\nNo need to say, your prison will be doomed for this joyful mission.

a48__at__desc_outbreak_3 Think carefully and find proper places for the remote bombs.\n\nThe explosion will range 3.5 meters. Walls closely nearby (in the four adjacent tiles) will be destroyed, too.
a48__at__desc_outbreak_4 Go back to the target and start a pas de deux with him.\nYour target will move synchronously with you. You two guys must knock down a Guard for jail keys.
a48__at__desc_outbreak_5 Let the target walk in front of a Guard to draw attention. Meanwhile, you should attack the focused Guard from behind.\n\nOnce you have done, you will explode all the bombs and arouse prisoners in 10 meters to seize the opportunity to escape.\n\n(Save the game first.)

So I decide to hide 48.)\n\nYou have thrown the prison into chaos.\nJail keys give you a big advantage over other poor prisoners.\nSmartly choose a devious route. Or boldly run past guards while other prisoners attract their attention.\n\nDue to limitations, the jail keys dropped will not be picked up for real.\nLet's just believe it happens.

a48__reward__outbreak \nYour target reached freedom after having a nice time at this crazy party.

research_PrisonerSorting Prisoner Sorting
researchtooltip_PrisonerSorting A snitch is murdered, again? Gangs are killing each other, again?\nWell, here is an automatic solution for you.\n\nUse a CCTV camera to sort "out" a certain type of inmates and categorize them as a proper one. Combined with zoning and regime, you can minimize or eliminate the chance they may meet the rest of prisoners.


object_TargetSorter Target Sorter
buildtoolbar_popup_uts_TargetSorter Snitches as well as Ex Law Enforcement / Guards and (if you have enabled "Events") Federal Witnesses are thorns in every prisoner's flesh. They will be targeted for murder sooner or later.\nThe best countermeasure is to categorize them as Protected Custody and provide them an isolated wing to live in.\nThis "utility" can upgrade a CCTV Camera, enabling it to detect and categorize snitches automatically.\nThe range of its detection is 7 meters.\n\n"Install" this at an existing CCTV Camera to upgrade it.\n\nThe room which needs it most is Reception.

object_GangSorter Gang Sorter
buildtoolbar_popup_uts_GangSorter If you have enabled Gangs, there will be continuous conflicts among the three gangs.\nThe best countermeasure is to group them into different security categories (Min, Med and Max), each of which has an (at least mostly) isolated wing to live in.\nThis "utility" is similar to Target Sorter.\n\nDon't worry, Target Sorter has higher priority than this.\n\nBesides new intake, new members can be recruited by gangs in prison, so you may need more than one CCTV Cameras upgraded with this.

object_RoomSelector Room Selector
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_RoomSelector The first step to clone a room.\nClick any tile in the room, all tiles of that room including walls and doors will be selected.\n\nWhen detecting, it assumes the room is a rectangle.\nFor performance reasons, in each of the four directions the detection will go as far as 10 meters.\n\nEvery new selection will replace an old one.\n\nClick the Selector object, and you can adjust the selected area via context menu.

buildtoolbar_popup_staff_ClearSelector The last step to clone a room.\nPlace anywhere and the existing selection of room will be cleared.

object_CloneSimple Clone Simple
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_CloneSimple Clone the room with this tile as top left.\nAll fixtures (objects except Laundry Baskets) including lights will be replicated.\nAnd floor materials, too.\nRepeat this operation will not result in duplicate objects at same tiles.\n\nDue to limitations, I cannot edit foundation and thus duplicate indoors/outdoors properties.\nThis issue affects light, fog of war and temperature.\nYou have to build (or Bulldoze) foundation by regular operations.\nAnd room types are not clonable either.\n\nIf you haven't enabled Cheats, workmen will build walls and objects.\nAlthough you may not see these walls when [Staff] build bar menu is open, they are in queue of construction.

object_CloneSpreadAligned Clone Spread Aligned
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_CloneSpreadAligned Clone repeatedly in a row starting from the selected room.\n\nParticularly suitable for cloning a row of column of jail cells.\nAll new rooms will be aligned to the selected one horizontally or vertically.\n\nYou are advised to save before you do this.

object_CloneSpreadAngled Clone Spread Angled
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_CloneSpreadAngled Clone repeatedly in a row starting from the selected room.\n\nNew rooms will form an angle that is neither horizontal nor vertical.\nThe relative position of target tile from the Selector object decides what angle and how many clones will be made. The offset between the new rooms will be an identical integer (meters). So the formation will be very regular.\n\nSome players who like creative shapes will need this feature.\n\nYou are advised to save before you do this.

object_CloneFlipX Clone Flip X
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_CloneFlipX Clone the room with this tile as top left.\nIn the new room, X property of every objects is mirrored.\nBut for symmetry, doors are not mirrored.

anchor_tt Oh, you find this.\nIt is a very special object for me to work around some limitations.\nWhen you have hired a Warden, and load the map again, this anchor will be gone since Warden carries on its role.\n\nWhatever, just leave it.

object_MoveObject Move Object
object_MoveObjectMarker Move-Object Marker
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_MoveObject Move all objects from a tile to another.\n\nFirstly, locate and mark the tile where your objects are with this "staff".\nThen use this again to locate the tile to move to.\n\n[Exceptions]\nIt is very likely that you are not expecting to move a light but it just happens to be above what you really want to move, so I exclude lights.\nPower Station, Capacitor and Water Pump Station have underground parts which cannot be moved. Water Pump Station moved will leak water. So I exclude them, too.\n\nAfter being moved or rotated, a few objects may have weird problems. For example, Cookers and Fridges will show icons about lacking electricity. You just need to dismantle and reinstall them.

# `-- "PowerStation", "WaterPumpStation", "Capacitor",


object_RotateObject Rotate Object
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_RotateObject Rotate an object clockwise 90 degrees.\n\nThe wall aligning of the object might be wrong occasionally.\n\nAnd you may find the image of the object stays unchanged even though a rotation does happen. Only dev team can fix this bug.\nWhat you can do now is to move the object somewhere and move back.


object_MoveRoom Move Room
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_MoveRoom Move all fixtures and materials of the selected room to a new relative position.\nOperates just like Clone Simple.\nA difference is that the new position can be inside the selected room.




object_LightHere Light Here
buildtoolbar_popup_staff_LightHere For many reasons, you may have some redundant lights to be removed or misplaced ones to be moved.\n\nSince they often overlap other objects and people, it is difficult to select them.\nThis "staff" can help you to...\n · delete nearby lights\n · and spawn a light at this tile\n\nThe range of deletion is 2.2 meters in the same room.\nEach light deleted will add $30 to you Bank Balance, so the operation equals to move a light (if there is one) and delete the rest redundant ones.

Not cool.\n\nCan you lower the guard-prisoner ratio to 1/5?\n\n[Tips]\nTo get most of your guards, you should...\n · Let them rest conveniently\n · Not let them waste time on opening doors.\n · Enable them to arrive quickly via a good road/path system. \n · Use Deployment Scheduler a lot and wisely.\n\nThe progresses of this grant are inverted. If you see 4% about guards, it means you have 4% (25 × 4% = 1) above the requirement and thus you need to fire 1 guard.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_nothing Nothing inside.\n\nThis "room" can be used to spare walls and doors, and thus let people walk through quickly.\nIt is also good at dividing sectors for zone settings in Deployment mode.\nFor example:\n · Make a tiny sector beside a door and assign a guard to station.\n · In front of a door to a Shared zone (such as Mail Room), make a tiny zone for prisoners of a specific category to enter.




buildtoolbar_popup_room_cell A single room.\n\nPrisoners sleep here at night. Or, dig tunnels.\n\nWhen incarcerated in cell, prisoners' Freedom need will accumulate.\n\nThe research Small Cells can allow you to increase space utilization if you are mean to prisoners.\n\n[Tweaks]\nI replaced Office Desk with School Desk Cell Grading requirements list for the sake of reality.\nHowever, I recommend you disable Cell Quality Grading at all...\n\nMoreover, you can click a prisoner to select him, then Right Click any tile in the cell which you want him to move into. A Guard will escort him.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_holdingcell A room where new recruits are placed until a cell is found for them.\n\nA good way to save money when your prison just start.\n\nAnd if Cell Quality Grading is enabled, new intake probably will not get a proper cell for them upon arrival, and therefore this room will be necessary.\n\nNo need to worry about a capacity of inmates. But clearly it is not a good idea to hold too many here too long.\nIf you have to do so, remember to install Bunk Beds, etc. And deploy a Guard.\n\nBeds here are not counted as your prison capacity.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_solitary An isolated form of imprisonment for the worst of the worst.\n\nWhen punished as solitary, a prisoner will be shackled and sent here.\n\nThe Suppressed status of that prisoner will rise and thus make him very docile.\nSolitary is an important approach to higher score of the Punishment index in Grading of tough prisoners.\n\nMoreover, you can recruit informants from some of inmates here.\n\nThe shackled prisoners cannot go out for dinner; (idle) Guards will take food from Serving Tables to them.\n\nAlthough not required, a Toilet is usually needed.\nNo Bed. Even you install some, they will not be used nor counted as capacity.
# `An isolated form of imprisonment for the worst of the worst.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_dormitory A variable-size room for housing multiple prisoners. \nThat bigger it is, the more it can hold.\n(4 square meters for 1 prisoner)\n\nA major side effect is the increase of Privacy need.\nThis need seems to urge prisoners to dig tunnels. And they do so collaborately.\n\n[Tweaks]\nI edited Cell Grading requirements list.\nEspecially the room sizes per prisoner.\nAnd it is no longer supposed to be like a common room with things such as Pool Table.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_canteen What to say? Everyone is busy with their mouths eating, aren't they?\n\nActually, many kinds of things can be done here, too.\nAs long as there is enough space, this room can be used as an informal Common Room.\nIn fact, you are advised to add some objects for needs other than Food when prisoners have finished their meals but are not allowed to leave at Eat regime.\n\nYou can consider one or two Kitchen Sinks at Canteen, too.\n\nAs a result of high density of prisoners, they are likely to spontaneously enjoy some unofficial activities such as fighting. So you must strengthen security.\n\nA trick: If you don't like Tables which take much space, you can keep one only (for requirements). Prisoners can eat on benches alone. Of course, not realistic.\n\nRecommended Zoning: Unlocked\n\nIf Staff Needs is enabled, set a Canteen as Staff-Only for staff on break to enjoy their food.
# `Where your prisoners will take their afternoon tea.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_kitchen Area for cooks to prepare food for your prisoners.\n\nStart preparing food 4 hours before Eat regime.\nCooks will carry food ingredients from Deliveries to Fridges at Kitchen.\nThe higher the Meal Quantity and Variety are in [Reports/Policy], the more ingredients and Cooks are needed.\nHigh Quantity and Variety can result in Well-Fed status among prisoners, which can make them feel good and unlikely to misbehave. Also can increase the Health index in prison Grading.\nIf Weather and Temperature is enabled, a lot of heat will be generated here.\n\nYou can let prisoners work as prison labour at very low wages. This has both pros and cons.\n\nEach prisoner need 12 square meters to work.\nMax Jobs: 20\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Staff-Only or Min Sec]\n\n[Tweaks]\nKitchen Sinks are no longer required and you can install them at Canteen.
# `Area for cooks to prepare food for your prisoners.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_shower Used to keep your prisoners squeaky clean, and lice free.\n\nWith Shower regime, you can force prisoners to come here.\nBut in fact, the act of showering has nothing to do with rooms.\nYou are advised to install shower facilities in Yards or Jail Cells.\nThey are equally usable and not mandatory.\n\nDon't forget to place Drains along the entrance or simply under Shower Heads.
# `Used to keep your prisoners squeaky clean, and lice free.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_yard Let your prisoners see the sun for a few hours a day, do some exercises etc.\nWith Yard regime, you can force prisoners to come here.\nMainly satisfies Freedom and Exercise needs.\nMany kinds of objects can be installed here. Like Benches, TVs, Phone Booths, Weighing Benches.\n\nToilets and Shower Heads may also be needed according to regimes immediately previous or next to Yard regime.\n\nA perfect place for a Guard Tower to demonstrate its large range of suppression influence.\n\n[Tweaks]\nI don't know why but Yards could be indoors? Too unrealistic. Edited.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_storage Area designated to hold any materials your prison staff need. \n\nIdle Workmen come here.\nYou may build two or three Storage rooms to save Workmen's time on road.\nDon't let prisoners access and steal contrabands.\n\nNew objects (like doors) of some types will be created in magically at Deliveries or Storage rooms. Unrealistic. But saves time and I decide to keep these configurations.\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Staff-Only]
# `
buildtoolbar_popup_room_deliveries Trucks drop off objects, materials and new prisoners here.\nOf course, this is the first stop for most contrabands.\n\nYou'd better extend it long along the Road to allow more than one trucks to idle at the same time.\nEach truck needs 10 meters.\nTrucks will drop off their loads at the first (top) Deliveries. So building another Deliveries will meaningless.\nIf this room is adjacent to Garbage and Exports, Workmen can load while unloading.\n\nMaking these rooms indoors or at least enclosed with Fences will be wise for security.\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Staff-Only]
# `Where your goods, materials, and prisoners are dropped off.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_garbage Where your waste is collected to be later loaded on a truck.\n\nIdle Janitors come here.\nCooks need to dump food waste. So you may need more than one Garbage rooms around your prison.\nNo need to worry about contrabands. Free to choose places for these rooms.
# `Where your waste is collected from.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_execution Death Row inmates are executed here.\n\nFor the several staff and witnesses, this room had better be at least 20 square meters.\nWitnesses need five chairs, though they can stand with no complaints.\n\nNb to receive your first Death Row intake, you must have a Jail Cell zoned as Death Row. And the prison should be able to walk from his cell to this room for execution.\n\nYou are advised to start executions at night when all prisoners are sleeping.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_exports Products manufactured at Workshops are collected to be loaded and sold later.\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Staff-Only]
buildtoolbar_popup_room_workshop Where you send your prisoners to die of boredom while making car license plates.\n\nThe sales can probably be a considerable share of the income of your prison.\n\nIf trained better, prisoners can make woodwork for higher profit.\n\nProcedure about woodwork:\n1. Get Logs from Forestries.\n2. Process them into Wood with Workshop Saws.\n3. Process them into Superior Beds with Carpenter Tables.\nWood can be purchased or sold independently as well.\n\nEach prisoner need 12 square meters to work.\nMax Jobs: 20\n\nAbout out of 5 Max-Sec prisoners can come to work.\nAbout 1/4 of them can operate Carpenter Tables.\nAs to Med-Sec, 7 and 1/9.\n\nSometimes prisoners here may use tools at hand as weapons. You will need to deploy some Guards. Or better, build this room outdoors and let the range of a Guard Tower cover it.\n[Recommended Zoning: Med or Max Sec]\n\nPrisoners can create Wooden Pickaxes for digging tunnels. They are not metal and thus difficult to be detected.\n\nYou may create a very large Workshop containing facilities not only to work on but also to train with.\nOr you can separate into two, one for work and another for training.\nMinimize your guard suppression at the latter Workshop to maximize training success rate.\nYou may think about using Timed Caller, too.
# `Where you send your prisoners to die of boredom while making you car license plates.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_security Offices for your security staff.\nRegular Guards, Armed ones and Snipers will come here when idle.\n\nCCTV Monitors, Door Control Systems and Phone Taps are supposed to be installed and operated here.\nWhenever you activate an Informant, he will be escorted here to provide intelligence.\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Staff-Only]

buildtoolbar_popup_room_medicalward Where to store narcotics till some addicts steal them.\n\nSeriously, this room is where Doctors stay.\nInjured prisoners and staff will come or be taken to here.\nProgram Pharmacological Treatment of Drug Addiction takes place here, too.\n\nDoctors don't open doors for patients so you should choose Lockless Door.\n\nSince you cannot deny prisoners to enter, you really need to detect for contrabands.\n\nThe range of response of idle doctors is 20 meters.\n\nWhen you have multiple Infirmaries, you cannot assign a doctor to a certain one.\nSo you'd better call doctors back automatically with Medicine Cabinets.\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Unlocked + Access Only]\n\n[Tweaks]\nI made doctors tire more easily. You should have a Staffroom rather near.
# `Area for your medical staff to work.
buildtoolbar_popup_room_morgue Where you send your dead prisoners and staff to.\n\nA way-station between death scenes and Hearses.\nBut I don't see any noticeable impact if I lack it.\n\nNo requirement for walls. You can simply build it next to an Infirmary.\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Staff-Only]

buildtoolbar_popup_room_commonroom Where your inmates do some activities and relax.\n\nThis room itself has no use. You need fill it will various objects to meet prisoners' needs.\nFor example, Bookshelves, Radios, TVs, Pool Tables, etc.\n\nActually these things can be installed at Yards and Canteens, too.\nYou might give high priorities to those rooms while building a few small Common Rooms at corners around your prison as supplements.\n\nFor program Alcoholics Group Therapy, you still need a large Common Room though.
# `Allowing your prisoners some freetime to relax.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_visitation Where prisoners meet their families face to face.\n\nSatisfies Family need.\n\nPrisoners can come even outside of work hours.\n\nSome families will bring in contrabands.\nVisitor Booths can cut down on such behavior. But unreconciled families will try another way.\n\nNb contrabands do not exist before families meet prisoners. They are not carried in but are spawned at meeting (according to prisoners' needs).\nSo there is no way to intercept them beforehand.\n\n[New Mechanic]\nYou lawyer can provide services here.\nThey government will reward you by the number of visitors.\n\nAbout out of 10 prisoners, 1 group of visitors will come per day.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_Laundry Where prisoners or Janitors make uniforms clean again to satisfy Clothing need.\n\nEach prisoner need 4 square meters to work.\nMax Jobs: 20\n\n1 Laundry Machine + 2 Ironing Boards + 4 Laundry Baskets + 4 prisoners can satisfy 64 prisoners' Clothing need.\n\nEvery wing (cell block) should have its own Laundry room.\n\nAfter massive constructions in your prison, you'd better check if every link between wing and Laundry is correct in [Logistics/Laundry Distribution].
buildtoolbar_popup_room_cleaningcupboard A pre-requisite for prisoners to clean floors indoors like Janitors do.\n\nBleach here has no use. Just decoration for reality.\n\nEach prisoner need 4 square meters to work.\nMax Jobs: 20\n\nIf your prison is clean enough, you won't need to build any Cleaning Cupboard at all.\nIn fact, I suggest you not.\nThis room is source of these contrabands:\n · Poison is a substitute for drugs.\n · Club is a weapon that cannot be detected at all.\nGiven the trouble of these contrabands, I don't think this room is worthy. Just hire a few Janitors.\nIf Jail Cells are behind Lockless Doors, the efficiency of Janitors will be extremely high.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_staffroom Let your staff recharge energy fast.\n\nChoose places wisely and your staff will have long work time.\n\nOnly Armed Guards, Snipers and Dogs rest elsewhere.\n\n[Recommended Zoning: Staff-Only]\n\nYou can install CCTV Monitors, Door Control Systems and Phone Taps here, too.\nAnd time gap (when no Guard is operating) will be minimized.\nOf course, it will be better if you build it adjacent to a Security room with no wall in between.\nSofas don't help recharging energy.\n\nBut if you have enabled Staff Needs, well, many things are different here.


buildtoolbar_popup_room_library Your prison will be sent boxes of discarded and used books from around the country. Prisoners will need to sort those books onto the shelves.\n\nBooks can be used to satisfy Library need.\n\nAfter borrowing a book from here, a prisoner will sit on a Bench at Canteen or on a Chair at his cell.\nAs to places like Common Rooms, it seems not quiet enough for reading.\nVery quickly as they read, prisoners will spend much time on walking.\n\nAfter some days, books will be ruined and new ones will be replenished.\n\nEach prisoner need 12 square meters to work.\nMax Jobs: 20

buildtoolbar_popup_room_Forestry Grow trees and produce logs.\n\n1. Gardeners will automatically plant new trees.\nIt takes 8 to 9 days for a tree to fully grow up.\n3. Workmen fell the trees and get logs.\n4. In Workshop, logs are processed by Workshop Saws into woods.\n\nYou'd better build five Forestries, one by one every two days.\n\nNb. Every tree automatically planted will occupy 4×4 tiles, with 1 meter as margins.\n[New Feature] Tree stumps forced new tree to be planted elsewhere, which made Forestries very disordered. Now, stumps are automatically deleted and thus leave positions for new trees.

buildtoolbar_popup_room_Classroom Where academic reform programs are held.\n\nInterest rate of Foundation Education Program is as low as 1/10. So the demand of Classroom is not much.\n\nIf a Guard stations or patrols here and suppresses the students, the latter will have difficulty in concentration.\nIf you are afraid of troubles among these prisoners, the best way is asking a Guard come here just one hour before and one after the class session with Deployment Scheduler.\n\n[New Feature]\nA better option is using Timed Called.\nOr, you can simply make the tiles next to Classroom outdoors and let a Guard patrol there while their influence will be restricted outdoors.

But no letter will be sent out.\n\nPrisoners can work here.\n\nThe zoning of this room decides prisoners of which category will be recipients.\n(The recipients depends on sorters. The causality is reversed.)\nOnly when set as Shared can all prisoners are able to get mails.\nIf prisoner working here are not allowed to access some cell wings (blocks), idle Guards will deliver instead.\n\nYou need only one Mail Room.\n\nDon't forget to detect contrabands hidden in new mails.\n\nThe number of mails per day is 1/4 of the total prisoner population.\nGive that there are 8 hours of work time (just 7 hours in effect) per day, you need 1 prisoner to sort letters for 50.\nEach prisoner need 12 square meters to work.


buildtoolbar_popup_room_shop A legal way for prisoners to spend their cash and discharge a few types of needs immediately.\n\nYou can gain a little income only better than none.\nIt is said that the existence of Shop can motivate prisoners to work to earn cashes.\n\nAbout the goods:\n\n · Brown=Food: Snack\n · Blue=Hygiene: Soap & Shampoo\n · Green=Recreation: Magazine\n\nInstall a Shop Front in the wall of this room for customers to buy goods at the other side.\n\nShop can be run by prisoners only.\nThe number of prisoners working should equals to the number of Fronts.\nIf footfall (traffic of customers) is really big, you may need hire one more to replenish Shelves dedicatedly.\nThe smaller the size, the better.\nWorkmen will try to fill every tile by delivering goods.\n\nDue to a bug, Workmen may carry goods back to Storage.\nThe best solution is: no prisoner dedicated for Shelves. All goods will be in queue of loading on shelf and thus unable to be carried to Storage.\n\n[Tweaks]\nI removed Table from the requirements list.\nIt takes too much space. Workmen always fill floors with goods anyway.

So I chose the tooltips of these objects to do that.\n\nNb Food policy has nothing to do how many meals you give per day. I assume you give 2.
# `Dish up food to your prisoners.
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_showerhead Showering can satisfy Hygiene need.\nDecrease Rate: 5\nIf Weather and Temperature is enabled, naked prisoners won't enjoy cold water.\n\nShowering with hot water makes your prisoners happier.\n\nWhen you place these, try not to make prisoners too crowded.\nCan be installed at rooms other than Shower room.\n\n[Tweaks]\nPrice was $20. Now, $100. I discourage you from providing shower facilities at jail cells because in reality this seldom happens.
# `The head of a shower. For showering. Showering with hot water makes your prisoners happier.
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_bookshelf As the name implies. (But not really.)\n\nExists for a higher score of Cell Quality Grading.\n\n[Tweaks]\nI scaled down the images.

And now it can attach to wall properly, too.\nCan be used for Reading Book (fake) to satisfy Literacy need.\nDecrease Rate: 0.3\nIts priority is lower than that of borrowing real books from Library.\n\nHas little impact on walk speed (0.8)
# `A shelf that holds books.
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_officedesk Your administrative staff need to write things down a lot. Give them a shiny office desk to do it on.\n(Nothing but an item in the requirements list.)\n\nHas little impact on walk speed (0.8)\n\n[Tweaks]\nThe old images of it facing west and east are mistaken with each other. So I corrected them.\nPrice was $50, now is $200.\n\nI didn't change its unrealistic move speed factor because staff keep wandering at office.\nI never feel right when I see these desks at jail cells. So I replaced it with School Desk in the Cell Quality Grading list.

But for reality, prisoners still prefer visitors.\n\nCan be placed at Yards, Common Rooms, Canteens, Nurseries and Holding Cells.\n\nObviously, it can be wired to Phone Taps.
# `Prisoners might want to talk to their family, and these handy phonebooths let them.
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_visitortablesecure Allow families to talk with prisoners face to face through thick glass.\nDisables these guys bring in contrabands.\nAnd these Booths can be tapped since they have embedded phones.\nWhen placing them, you should be aware of the different sides for visitor and prisoner respectively.\nMoreover, in response, the two groups of guys will arrange somewhere and sometime for the family to throw contrabands over the outermost walls of your prison and the prisoner to pick up.\nThe range is 10 meters from the walls into your prison.\nYou should set these areas as Staff-Only to make them give up.\n\nThis is one the few objects which can block ways.

# `
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_largetv Allow lots of your prisoners to share the experience of brain rot.\n\nRange: 7×7\nSince the side is an odd number, the range is unable to align tiles exactly but has an offset of 0.5 meter.\n\n[Tweaks]\nI cannot edit the range, so I decided to make the width of the object become 1 meter, an odd number.\nI also increased its price so that it is no longer too cost-effective.\n\nHas a great impact on walk speed (0.3)

buildtoolbar_popup_obj_workshopsaw The most basic tool at Workshop. Can be used to process...\n · 1 Sheet Metal into 2 License Plates (Blank) in 12 minutes\n · 1 Log into 4 Wood in 30 minutes\n\nYou cannot disallow one of them in order to produce the other exclusively.\n\nSheet Metal is purchased from outside and thus never lacks.\n\nLogs come from your Forestries.\n\n\n[Tweaks]\n\nI made License Plate (Blank) sellable. Otherwise, they will stack up and thus disable Saws to process Logs. Reasonably, their price is not much. I also lowered the price of Wood from $50 to $40. So you cannot be too rich only by making Wood.\nProfitability of Log → Wood:\n(30×4-50)÷30×60=140 per man-hour\nStill very profitable!
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_workshoppress Can be used to process a License Plate (Blank) into a License Plate (Finished) in 6 minutes.\n\nThe number of Presses to that of Saws for License Plates (Blank) should be 1:1.\n\nCurious about Profitability?\n1 Sheet Metal → 2 License Plates (Blank) → 2 License Plates (Finished)\n(10×2-10)÷(12+6×2)×60=25 per man-hour\nHow do you feel about this truth?
buildtoolbar_popup_obj_carpentertable  Can be used to process 5 Wood into 1 Superior Bed a License Plate (Finished) in 60 minutes.\n[Tweaks]\nI lowered 5 Wood to 4.\nSo the number of Carpenter Tables to that of Saws for Wood should be 2:1.\n\nSince price of Wood is lower and that of Superior Bed is higher, Superior Beds are now indeed worth your troubles.\n\nProfitability of 1 Tree Sapling → 3 Logs → 3×4 Wood → 3×4÷4 Superior Bed:\n(500×3×4÷4-100)÷(30×3+60×3×4÷4)×60=311 per man-hour

ceos_letter Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nCongratulations on completing your basic induction - you are now a fully qualified Prison Architect! Soon you'll be designing, building and running your own prisons starting from nothing but an empty plot of land and a few stacks of bricks. Before you get started, I thought I might share some important lessons with you.\n\n1. Every prison needs a Warden - he should be one of your first hires. Build him a nice office and he'll open up a whole range of advanced facilities via the bureaucracy system.\n\n2. Individual jail cells are expensive, especially early on when funds are very tight. Save money by starting with a single large Holding Cell, which can be shared between many prisoners at once.\n\n3. Get your Kitchen and Canteen up and running before the first prisoners show up, and be sure to hire some Cooks - nothing irritates a prisoner more than an empty stomach!\n\n4. Building a prison is an expensive undertaking, and you need to become a master of raising large volumes of money through grants and contracts. You can access these grants through the 'Reports' screens.\n\nThat's about everything - good luck!\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp.\n\n== Updates (2017-05-21) ==\n\n · [Improvement] Misconduct Markers are smaller and more transparent, so they are less likely to block your view.\n · [Improvement] For Faster Sleep (only when Cheats are enabled), the special object "Needs Modifier for Faster Sleep Time" used to cost a lot of money which may astonishes players. Now its price is 0, and it is no longer shown in Objects menu.\n · [Fixed] In six types of rooms, even when they are not Staff-Only, staff should still be able to rest there. I didn't know this feature and accidentally disabled it.\n · [Fixed] Error when hiring a Foreman.\n · [Fixed] Agent 48 cannot be removed at the beginning and need to meet a prisoner before the "Abort and Walk off" menu item appears.\n · [Fixed] Drinking Machine may cause staff stuck occasionally.\n · [Fixed] Pressure Pad is displayed above trucks.\n · [Workaround] Strangely, few players' games don't provide scripts with access to bank balance. This causes Debuggger window to pop when my scripts (e.g. of Drinking Machine) give or take money.\n · [Fixed] Cctv Camera with Gang Sorter upgrade didn't work properly.\n · Replaces "Admitted Guilty" and "Not Admitted" with "Plea: Guilty" and "Plea: Not guilty".\n · [Fixed] The Cancel button in [Execution] window could not be clicked.\n · [Fixed] The preacher entry in biographies.txt was missing.\n · Adds language Italian\n\n[Tips]\n · Press - and + keys to zoom most UI elements.\n · Press 1, 2 and 3 to set game speed as 1, 2 and 5 times.\n   Click the three buttons under the clock to set as 2, 4, 10.\n · Save often!\n\n{All-in-One Deluxe Edition}\nGrandSong@163.com\n\nSend me emails if you want to do something really serious.\nFor example, translations into other languages.\nI will send you a boilerplate language file, tools files and a foolproof tutorial.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_guards_4 \nIf you have Micromanagement unlocked, you will have access to the Deployment Scheduler. \nThis lets you create a timetable of when guards are assigned to certain areas. \nFor example, if you only wanted Guards deployed in the Canteen during the Eat regime, you could...
# `\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_guards_5 ~\nClick each block of the Scheduler that lines up with your Eat regime (in white color by default) and mark them as the same number (1) and color (green).\nThen click a number of time above these blocks to move the red time slider above that block.\nLastly, click your Canteen to assign guards.
\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_guards_6 \nNow, if you move the red time slider to other blocks, you will see no guards at that canteen.\nSo, in that time you can assign guards to other places.\n\nNb. The default color of block (white) means assignment is active for all 24 hours.\nIf you haven't click to set the red time slider yet, or you purposely click the white slider, your assignment will be active for the default 24 hours.\nBe careful when you edit this useful yet tricky scheduler.

# `The Zoning tools let you control which prisoners are allowed into which areas of your prison, with Shared and Unlocked being open to all prisoner categories.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_zoning_4 \nShared and Unlocked zones are open for all prisoners to access.
# `\nSince no prisoners are allowed to enter Staff-Only areas, this allows you to create "airlocks" that can keep prisoners in certain areas from accessing otherwise shared facilities. This can be especially useful if, for example, you wanted to keep all of your protected custody prisoners inside their own area, away from a shared Yard or Common Room.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_zoning_5 \nBasically, as long as you set zoning properly for rooms, you can use Lockless Doors instead of Staff Doors and even Jail Doors.
# `\nIf a zone is set to Unlocked, all doors in that area will be locked open.


buildtoolbar_deployment_ProtectedZone Only 'Protected Custody' prisoners will be permitted to enter this sector.\n\nAbout out of 15 new prisoners, 1 will need protected.\n\nYou should separate them from the rest of your inmates.\nPrepare enough cells for these guys in advance.

# `Only 'superMax' security prisoners will be permitted to enter this sector.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_jobs_5 \nWorking prisoners are paid a small amount for every hour that they work. Allocating the maximum number of jobs might not necessarily be the best idea; prisoners still get paid even if there is nothing for them to do.\n\nAnd to keep prisoners' misbehaviors and contrabands in check, you need to deploy some guards.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_targettinglaundry_4 ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_targettinglaundry_5 Laundry rooms can target as many different rooms as you want, but they are limited in how fast they can operate (based on their size and the number of Prisoners or Janitors working there). Having a single laundry serve an entire large prison can work, but each room will get their clothes very sporadically.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_1       The Room Quality view shows you the quality of all of the cells and dormitories in your prison, graded from 0 to 10 - the higher the number, the better the quality. Mousing over a room will show you the factors that went into determining it's quality, and what you can add to increase that quality.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_2       ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_3       - Prisoners are entitled to a higher quality cell for good behaviour over time. Having higher quality cells available is a good way to incentivise good behaviour.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_4       - It's important to keep some low quality cells in your prison, as new arrivals to your prison will need somewhere to go, and if all the available cells are too high quality they might find themselves in a holding cell.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_5       - Prisoners can be placed in a higher quality cell than they deserve if there is no other space available, but it might make the other prisoners unhappy...

buildtoolbar_popup_help_jobs_4              - Some jobs, such as working in the kitchen or workshop, require the prison to have passed a training course first. You can run these courses from the Programs tab of your report window.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_jobs_5              - Working prisoners are paid a small amount for every hour that they work. Allocating the maximum number of jobs might not necessarily be the best idea; prisoners still get paid even if there is nothing for them to do.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_1           The Dangers view shows which contraband a prisoner can steal from each of the rooms in your prison. Additionally, you can see the supply and demand of each type of contraband to the right. If the demand of a specific type of contraband is higher than the supply, a prisoner is more likely to try and steal it, especially if they are in desperate need of something themselves.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_2           ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_3           - Not all rooms that are sources of contraband need to be accessed by prisoners, and their access to those rooms can be restricted or blocked entirely.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_source_4           - While this shows you which rooms in your prison contraband can be stolen from, rooms aren't the only way for prisoners to get what they need...

buildtoolbar_popup_help_contraband_3        ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_contraband_4        - If you are finding that a lot of contraband is coming from a relatively small number of places, it might be time to beef up security in those areas.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_4         ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_5         - Small electrical items, like lights and TVs, will automatically connect to power as long as an electrical cable is nearby. Larger items, such as Laundry Machines or Water Pumps, will need to be connected directly to the cable.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_6         - Large water pipes can carry water over a long distance, but smaller pipes have a shorter range. Having a single large pipe leading to a building or area, and connecting individual objects using smaller pipes, is a good way to save money.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_utilities_7         - The Utilities view can have a lot going on, especially in larger prisons. Clicking on a specific object will highlight the related connects much more clearly, making it easier to see. For example, clicking electrical cables will make all electrical cables and objects in your prison much clearer.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_guard_3             ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_guard_4             - Guards can find escape tunnels by searching toilets in Cells. If the toilet is searched specifically, they will find any escape tunnels without fail.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_guard_5             - If you have a Security Chief, you can see how many idle Guards you have on the information bar at the top of the screen. If you frequently have 0 Guards available, it might be an indication that you don't have enough guards to keep up with their current workload.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_workman_1           Workmen are the people who build your prison, help unload deliveries and, in some cases, bring those deliveries to the various areas of your prison.\n\n

buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_1        Armed Guards are used to keep especially dangerous or unruly prisoners in line, carrying a shotgun with them at all times. They Suppress all nearby Prisoners making them much less likely to cause trouble, and if their life is threatened they will use their shotgun, which will usually make all other nearby prisoners stop causing trouble.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_2        ~With an Armed Guard selected, you can order them to move anywhere in your prison by Right Clicking that location. \n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_3        ^Tips
buildtoolbar_popup_help_armedguard_4        - If the Freefire button is activated, Armed Guards will not wait until their life is in danger before using their shotgun. They will just open fire on any prisoners causing trouble.

researchtooltip_warden                  Unlocks the Warden, and the entire Bureaucracy system.  Hire him from the Staff toolbar.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.
researchtooltip_security                Unlocks the Chief of Security, who can be hired from the staff toolbar.  The chief gives you access to the Deployment screen, and will also give you a realtime report of the danger level of your prison, often predicting future trouble.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.
researchtooltip_maintenance             Unlocks the Foreman.  Hire him from the Staff toolbar.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.
researchtooltip_legal                   Unlocks the Lawyer, who can be hired from the Staff toolbar. Unlocks a number of research options to give you greater control over your prison.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.
researchtooltip_deployment              Allows you to permanently station Guards to the sectors of your Prison.
researchtooltip_patrols                 Allows you to define patrols around crucial areas of your prison (eg the perimeter), and assign guards to walk those patrols.
researchtooltip_dogs                    Unlocks the Dog Handler and Guard Dog.  They excel in sniffing out the smelly contraband in your prison, and detecting escape tunnels.\n\nDogs are also very fast which allows them to chase prisoners with ease.
researchtooltip_cctv                    Unlocks CCtv cameras and security monitors.  Use these to keep watch on unmanned parts of your prison.\n\nAlso unlocks the Phone Tap system, which allows you to listen in on prisoner phone calls and gain vital intelligence.
researchtooltip_remoteaccess            Unlocks high-tech equipment for remote control and automation of doors. Doors can be opened remotely using a Door Control System (operated by a Guard), or opened by a Door Timer at specific times of day.
researchtooltip_riotguards              (CURRENTLY SERVES NO PURPOSE)\nUnlocks the Riot Guard.  These guys are armoured and better able to deal with violent situations.
researchtooltip_maintainance            Unlocks the Foreman.  He allows you to do further research on things like Prison Labour, or additional staff members like the Gardener.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.
researchtooltip_clone                   Unlocks the clone tool on the main toolbar.  Use this tool to rapidly duplicate areas of your prison, such as Cells.  To use, select a zone to be copied with a right mouse drag, then left click to stamp down a copy.
researchtooltip_groundskeeping          Unlocks the Gardener.  He will keep your outdoor areas tidy.
researchtooltip_cleaning                Unlocks the Janitor.  He will clean all the indoor areas of your prison and can also help with the prison laundry service.

researchtooltip_MentalHealth            Unlocks the Psychologist, providing you with a valuable insight into your Prisoner's internal psychological state at all times.\n\nLike all Administrators, he requires an office to work.
researchtooltip_finance                 Unlocks the Accountant, which gives access to the financial report for your Prison.\n\nAlso allows you to spend more each day than your income would normally allow, assuming you have the funds in reserve.\n\nLike all Administrators, she requires an office to work.
researchtooltip_landexpansion           Authorises you to purchase neighbouring plots of land, and thereby expand the size of your prison beyond its initial bounds.
researchtooltip_prisonlabour            Allows you to put your prisoners to work around your prison (Cooking, Cleaning etc), saving you on staff wages, earning you money, and teaching your prisoners new skills at the same time.\n\nAlso Unlocks the Workshop and the Laundry.
researchtooltip_education               Unlocks the ability to run educational reform programs for your prisoners, using externally hired teachers.
researchtooltip_contraband              Training for your Guards to become better at tracking and recovering contraband.

researchtooltip_policy                  Unlocks the Policy Report, allowing you to increase and decrease the punishments for all types of misconduct, as well as automatically triggering searches of the misbehaving prisoner and their cell.\n\nAlso allows you to control the nutritional policy, changing the quantity and variety of food served to prisoners.
researchtooltip_armoury                 Unlocks the armoury room, and allows you to deploy armed guards throughout your prison.
researchtooltip_bodyarmour              Equips all your Guards, Armed Guards and Dog Handlers with body armour. This can help absorb damage during a fight, but your guards will move slower.\n\nGuards must visit the armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for all body armour purchased this way.
researchtooltip_tazers                  Allows your Armed Guards to carry Tazers, a potent single-shot weapon that will render most targets unconscious instantly. Tazers can only be fired once before they need a full hour to recharge.\n\nArmed Guards must visit the armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for every tazer purchased this way.
researchtooltip_tazersforeveryone       Extends the Tazer program so that your regular Guards may also carry Tazers for defense.\n\nThey must visit the Armoury to get this equipment, and it will cost you for every tazer purchased this way.
researchtooltip_bankloans               Allows you to borrow large lump sums of money from the bank, in exchange for a daily payment of interest. Paying off your loans will increase your credit rating and allow you to borrow larger sums later.
researchtooltip_lowertaxes1             Takes advantage of government tax incentives and reduces your effective Corporation Tax rate to just 15%.\n\nYou will save $1,500 taxes per $10,000 of daily profit.
researchtooltip_lowertaxes2             Your accountant stretches the rules to breaking point, and moves all your official accounts and business processes to a foreign country with highly preferential tax rates. Your effective Corporation tax liability will drop to around 1%.\n\nYou will save a total of $3,000 taxes per $10,000 of daily profit.
researchtooltip_extragrant              Enables you to accept up to three grants simultaneously instead of two.
researchtooltip_advancedmanagement      Gives you the tools to micro manage aspects of your prison so they meet your exact requirements.\n\nUnlocks Food logistics, allowing you to specify which kitchens cook for which canteens, and which canteens inmates eat in.  Similarly, Laundry logistics lets you override which cell blocks are covered by which laundries.\n\nAlso unlocks the Deployment Scheduler, which lets you customise your guard deployment at different times of day.\n\nUnlocks the Reform Program Scheduler, letting you manually override the daily schedule of programs.
researchtooltip_permanentpunishment     Sometimes being in Prison just isn't locked away enough. Your lawyer can file the necessary papers to let you confine prisoners to a cell, permanently.
researchtooltip_removemincellsize       The cells in your prison require a certain amount of space to fit legal requirements. But imagine how many more cells you could fit in if that wasn't the case! Removes the minimum size requirements for standard cells.
researchtooltip_reduceexecutionliability Your lawyer lobbies for a reduction in the required strength of the conviction before death row proceedings can be properly started. Essentially lowers the number of appeals a prisoner gets before you can schedule their execution without liability.
researchtooltip_legalprep               Every prison runs into problems every now and then, and some of them come with fairly big legal consequences. Your lawyer will start the paperwork to help keep the heat off you should something go wrong, but this needs to be done in advance.
researchtooltip_legaldefense            You're in a bad situation - something went terribly wrong and you've been put on notice. If it looks like you aren't going to be able to manage the situation, your lawyer can help get you off the hook. Completing this research will remove any current warnings that might otherwise result in you being fired.
researchtooltip_guardtowers             Unlocks Guard Towers and Snipers, allowing you to have highly trained marksmen keeping an eye on the outdoor areas of your prison.\n\nSnipers will need to visit an armoury to collect a rifle, otherwise they will be unarmed.

research_legaldefense_adviser1          It looks like your lawyer has filed some paperwork that is protecting you from the consequences of this mess. I guess that means I can't fire you. This time.
research_legaldefense_adviser2          Get your prison in order, quickly, and make sure it stays in line. That trick won't work again and it won't protect you forever.

victory_adviserwarning_toomanydeaths1   Yesterday was a very dark chapter in the history of this prison. Far too many people lost their lives here.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanydeaths2   Make sure nobody else dies today, or you will face prosecution for criminal negligence.
victory_advisernotice_toomanydeaths1    Don't say we didn't warn you. You have been found guilty of criminal negligence because of recent events here.
victory_advisernotice_toomanydeaths2    You will now spend the next ten years in prison as punishment for your crime. Your own prison. Good luck.
victory_adviserwarning_riot1            Your prison is out of control. Put down this riot now, or the government will step in and retake the prison by force.
victory_advisernotice_riot1             You have failed to control this riot. The government has revoked our prison contract, and is now sending in the national guard to retake the prison.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanyescapes1  We have a PR disaster brewing here. Far too many prisoners have escaped recently, and it's your fault.
victory_adviserwarning_toomanyescapes2  Lock this place down and make sure nobody else escapes, otherwise the press will expect your head on a platter.
victory_advisernotice_toomanyescapes1   You have failed. This prison is a laughing stock in the media, and they want somebody to blame.
victory_advisernotice_toomanyescapes2   That somebody is you.  You're fired.
victory_adviserwarning_bankrupt1        We are bankrupt! Your disastrous management has led us to financial ruin.
victory_adviserwarning_bankrupt2        Find a way to fix this soon or you will be fired.
victory_advisernotice_bankrupt1         We have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and put the prison into administration. You have failed.
victory_adviserwarning_wardendeaths1    Working for you has become much too hazardous. We're struggling to find wardens who want to work at the prison.
victory_adviserwarning_wardendeaths2    If you let another warden die, we will have no choice but to fire you.
victory_advisernotice_wardendeaths1     You have failed to provide a safe working environment for your wardens. Everyone is afraid to work for you.
victory_advisernotice_wardendeaths2     We have no choice by to let you go. You are fired.
victory_adviserwarning_reoffenders1     A lot of the prisoners you have put up for early release have gone on to commit new crimes. This could cost us if we don't take control of the situation.
victory_adviserwarning_reoffenders2     If too many more prisoners reoffend upon release, you'll be the one to take the blame.
victory_advisernotice_reoffenders1      You have released too many dangerous criminals into the world. We have no choice but let you go. You have failed.
victory_adviserwarning_executions1      This is the second time that you have put an innocent prisoner to death. The public outrage is enormous.
victory_adviserwarning_executions2      If another innocent prisoner is executed, you will be held responsible.
victory_advisernotice_executions1       You have allowed too many innocent people to be executed. We cannot longer allow you to run this prison. You have failed.
victory_advisernotice_InnocentsExecuted1 You've just executed someone without following the proper procedure, and it turns out they were innocent. This is a gross  miscarriage of justice, and you are responsible. You're fired, and will probably be jailed yourself.

score_tooltip_punishment                This is a grading of how well the prisoner has been punished for their crimes, as perceived by the public. Serving a long term in prison is the foundation of a strong punishment, but hard times locked up alone will also count towards it.\n\nKeep in mind that too much reform or freetime will be seen as 'soft on crime' and will count against their punishment grade.\n\nA strong punishment score will deter the prisoner from re-offending after release.
score_tooltip_reform                    A grading of how well you have attempted to reform and rehabilitate this prisoner through the use of Reform programs.\n\nA high reform score will give the prisoner a much greater chance of finding genuine employment after release, and will therefore reduce their re-offending chance.\n\nNote: Putting your prisoners to work around the prison also counts towards this.
score_tooltip_health                    A record of the prisoners health and well-being during their stay in your prison. Outdoor exercise and good food count towards this. Injures that go untreated, drugs and alcohol usage all count against it.\n\nA poor score here will increase their chance of re-offending, particularly if the prisoner leaves prison with untreated drug or alcohol dependencies.
score_tooltip_security                  A grading that represents how well you have kept this prisoner safely locked away. Keeping prisoners locked in their cells under armed guard will count heavily towards this. You will be penalised if the prisoner is involved in fights, murders or escape attempts.\n\nA low score indicates the prisoner simply continued their criminal existence once inside your prison, and hence their re-offending chance will be high upon leaving.

score_tooltip_reoffendingchance         An estimate of the prisoners likelihood to re-offend after leaving prison. Many factors are taken into account to produce this value:\n\n- DECREASE Harsh/strong punishment\n- DECREASE Successful reform programs\n- INCREASE Poor health and security\n- INCREASE Untreated drug and alcohol addictions\n- INCREASE Gang membership\n\n\n- The prisoner's age is a major factor.\n- The number of prior convictions is a strong indicator.\n- A large supporting family can help.
score_tooltip_clemencychance_title      Likelihood of Clemency
score_tooltip_clemencychance            The likelihood that the Appeals Board will grant clemency and commute the prisoners death row sentence. Each unsuccessful appeal lowers this value until it is below the State Approved Conviction Strength, at which point full authorisation to proceed is given. Scheduling the execution before this point will result in extreme penalties if it is later found that the prisoner's appeal would have succeeded.\n\nIf clemency is granted, the prisoner will be immediately released (if found innocent), or transferred to Maximum Security (if still judged as guilty.)
score_tooltip_currentchance             The State Approved Conviction Strength is *X%
score_tooltip_clemencywarning           The chance of this prisoner being granted clemency is currently above the State Approved safe level. If you proceed with this execution, you will be held personally responsible if it is later found he would have been granted clemency.

needs_help_bladder                      Everyone needs to use the toilet, even prisoners. Don't forget that most parts of your prison Regime are pretty strict - they can't use the toilet in their cell if they are supposed to be in the shower room, for example.
needs_help_bowels                       Everyone needs to use the toilet, even prisoners. Don't forget that most parts of your prison Regime are pretty strict - they can't use the toilet in their cell if they are supposed to be in the shower room, for example.
needs_help_sleep                        Prisoners require sleep. Prisoners will only be able to sleep in the cell to which they are assigned, and will only sleep between 8pm and 8am. They'll obviously need a bed, too.
needs_help_food                         Everyone needs to eat, and most people need to eat more than once per day. If you find that your Kitchens aren't able to keep up with the demand, try hiring more Cooks or adding more Cookers to your Kitchens. You can also tweak your food policies in the Policies tab of your Report window.
needs_help_safety                       Even in prison, your Prisoners want to feel safe. If there are lots of fights in your prison or the overall danger level is high, prisoners will feel less safe, and may consider arming themselves. If this is becoming a problem, trying increasing the security throughout your prison by hiring more Guards, creating more patrols, or by seeing to the other needs of your Prisoners.
needs_help_hygiene                      Most Prisoners will want to wash regularly, especially in the mornings after they wake up. The Shower regime will force prisoners who don't have their own personal Shower to go to the nearest Shower room. If this is becoming a problem, consider expanding your Shower facilities, or adding more Freetime so Prisoners can shower as they need to.
needs_help_exercise                     Many prisoners will want to be able to keep in shape. You can help them do this by adding a Yard to your prison. Weights Benches, either in the Yard or other common areas, will also help with this.
needs_help_recreation                   A bored Prisoner is a dangerous Prisoner. You can see to a Prisoners need for Recreation by adding pass-times to the common areas of your prison, such as TVs or Radios.
needs_help_comfort                      Prisoners generally want to feel comfortable, physically and emotionally. There are many ways you can aid this, such as allowing for family visitations, giving them hot showers or simply making sure they have somewhere to sit.
needs_help_environment                  Prisoners hate living in dirty conditions, and with a lot of Prisoners using the same facilities, things can get messy pretty quickly. Hire some Janitors or put your Prisoners to work in a Cleaning Cupboard to keep on top of this.
needs_help_privacy                      Sometimes Prisoners will want some time to themselves. Spending time in their cell will usually see to this, but if they are living in a Dormitory with a lot of other prisoners, they might not find much Privacy there.
needs_help_freedom                      Even in prison, your Prisoners will want to feel as if they have some level of Freedom. You can facilitate this by adding some Freetime or Yard time to your Regime.
needs_help_clothing                     Prisoners are going to want clean clothes from time to time, even if it is just the same coloured jumpsuit. Adding a Laundry to your prison and either hiring Janitors or putting Prisoners to work in it will help make this dream a reality.
needs_help_drugs                        Many prisoners have problems with drug addiction - it might even be why they are in prison in the first place. You can help treat this problem by running a Drug Treatment Program in your Infirmary.
needs_help_alcohol                      Many prisoners struggle with alcoholism, and will go to great lengths to get their hands on some alcohol. You can try to help alleviate this by running Alcoholic Group Therapy sessions.
needs_help_spirituality                 Lots of prisoners have various religious beliefs. You can enable your prisoners' practice of these beliefs by adding Pews or Prayer Mats to your prison, but building a Chapel and running Spiritual Guidance programs will give the best results and generally help calm your prisoners too.
needs_help_literacy                     Some prisoners just want to read. Adding a Library will let those Prisoners borrow books to meet this need.
needs_help_warmth                       No one wants to be cold all the time, but nature doesn't really care about that. Adding radiators to your prison will keep your buildings warm enough to stop this becoming a problem.
needs_help_babysleep                    Babies need to sleep more than regular prisoners. If any of your Prisoners have a Baby, make sure you have Cots available so that the Baby can sleep as needed.
needs_help_babyplay                     Babies need engagement and entertainment. If any of your Prisoners have a Baby, make sure you have Play Mats in an accessible area.
needs_help_family                       Most Prisoners want to keep in contact with their families in one way or another. The easiest way to let them do this is to add Phones to your prison, though adding a Visitation facility to your prison will be much more effective. A Mail Room can also help with this need.

regimetooltip_nothing                   Prisoners are locked in their cells. They have nothing to do but reflect on the choices they made that led them to this place.\n\nLong stretches of lockup can prove a decisive punishment to even the hardest of prisoners.
regimetooltip_sleep                     Prisoners are locked in their cells, and the lights are turned out. Everyone goes to sleep.\n\nExcept those who are digging escape tunnels...
regimetooltip_eat                       Prisoners make their way to the nearest accessible canteen and sit down for lunch.\n\nPrisoners are permitted to use any facilities within the Canteen, but are not allowed to leave until this period ends.
regimetooltip_shower                    Prisoners strip off their clothes and get into the showers. Daily shower time is essential for prisoner hygiene, but some inmates will simply not bother unless forced to do so.
regimetooltip_yard                      Prisoners are let out of the facility and into the yard for some much needed exercise, sunlight and fresh air.\n\nPrisoners will make use of any facilities within the yard during this time, like the weight benches for working out, telephones to call loved ones, showers etc.
regimetooltip_work                      Prisoners are put to work around the prison.  Any job openings will be filled and prisoners will automatically report to their job locations. (You can set up job openings from the Deployment screen.)\n\nAll Reform programs also take place during Work time.  Prisoners without a job and not currently assigned to a Reform program are free to roam around the prison as if under 'Freetime'.
regimetooltip_freetime                  Prisoners are let out of their cell and are permitted to use any facilities around the prison. Prisoners enjoy this time best of all, and will socialise and take care of their needs as best they can.\n\nLong periods of freetime can reduce the stress and tension within your prison, but many believe it hardly counts as punishment.
regimetooltip_worklockdown              Prisoners are put to work around the prison.  Any job openings will be filled and prisoners will automatically report to their job locations. (You can set up job openings from the Deployment screen.)\n\nAll Reform programs also take place during Work time.  Prisoners without a job and not currently assigned to a Reform program are restricted to their cells as if under 'Lockup'.

regime_clear                            Clear the regime for this category of prisoner, and use the default Normal Security regime instead.

execution_result_ok                     The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. The standard compensation of $10,000 is awarded to the institution for their part in this process.
execution_result_appealed               The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Regrettably, new information came to light after the fact that would have affected his appeal for clemency, though no action will be taken against the institution and they will receive the standard compensation of $10,000 for their part in the process.
execution_result_innocent               The mandated execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Regrettably, evidence was later uncovered that revealed *N's innocence, though no action will be taken against the institution and they will receive the standard compensation of $10,000 for their part in the process.
execution_result_illegal                The execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Due to the failure to follow the legally required appeals process and the discovery of information that would have ultimately resulted in a successful appeal, the institution is fined $50,000. Due to the failure to follow proper protocol, executions are suspended until a later date, and any remaining Death Row prisoners will be transferred to another facility.
execution_result_illegalinnocent        The illegal execution of *N was carried out at *T as scheduled, by electric chair, in the presence of witnesses. Due to the failure to follow the legally required appeals process and the fact that *N was innocent of his crimes, the administrator of this facility is terminated from their position, effective immediately.
execution_warning_one                   Should the next execution performed here not follow the correct procedure, you will be fired from your position.
execution_warning_two                   Due to your past failures to follow correct procedure, one more breach of protocol in this manner will result in you being fired from your position.

ceos_letter                             Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n\nCongratulations on completing your basic induction - you are now a fully qualified Prison Architect!  Soon you'll be designing, building and running your own prisons starting from nothing but an empty plot of land and a few stacks of bricks.  Before you get started, I thought I might share some important lessons with you.\n\n1. Every prison needs a Warden - he should be one of your first hires.  Build him a nice office and he'll open up a whole range of advanced facilities via the bureaucracy system.\n\n2. Individual jail cells are expensive, especially early on when funds are very tight.  Save money by starting with a single large Holding Cell, which can be shared between many prisoners at once.\n\n3. Get your Kitchen and Canteen up and running before the first prisoners show up, and be sure to hire some Cooks - nothing irritates a prisoner more than an empty stomach!\n\n4. Building a prison is an expensive undertaking, and you need to become a master of raising large volumes of money through grants and contracts. You can access these grants through the 'Reports' screens.\n\nThat's about everything - good luck!\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp.

campaignchapter_deathrow                Death Row

campaignchapter_deathrow_description    We've been contracted to build an Execution Chamber at this prison, in time for the scheduled execution of one of their inmates.

campaigncutscene_deathrowmurder         Double Murder
campaigncutscene_deathrowconfession     Confession

adviser_deathrow_murder1                I knew I'd catch you two here.
adviser_deathrow_murder2                Edward! I...
adviser_deathrow_murder25               Don't.  Just... don't.
adviser_deathrow_murder3                What are you going to do?

adviser_deathrow_church1                Can I help you?
adviser_deathrow_church15               ...
adviser_deathrow_church2                Are you looking for forgiveness?
adviser_deathrow_church3                I don't know. I have to do something, I can't live with the things I've done.
adviser_deathrow_church4                You have to turn yourself in. Whatever you've done, you cannot evade the consequences.
adviser_deathrow_church5                You will never be able to live with yourself until you face up to your past.
adviser_deathrow_church6                I want to go back. I want to forgive her. I want her to forgive me.
adviser_deathrow_church7                God will forgive you, no matter what you have done, if you ask him to.
adviser_deathrow_church8                But you must answer for your crimes in the eyes of the law.  There is no other way.

adviser_deathrowintro_1                 This is a tough one.
adviser_deathrowintro_2                 There's a prisoner incarcerated at this facility who's been convicted of a double murder, and sentenced to death.
adviser_deathrowintro_3                 That's where we come in.  We've been contracted to construct an execution chamber in time for the guy's big day.
adviser_deathrowintrob_1                This is where I want the new facility to be built.
adviser_deathrowintrob_2                The first step with any project like this is to construct the building itself - with enough space inside to fit an execution room and a holding cell.
adviser_deathrowintrob_3                So let's get started.  Construct a new building here.

adviser_deathrow_explain1               Your Workmen are responsible for the construction of buildings.
adviser_deathrow_explain2               They'll collect the steel and concrete from this store room and take it to the construction site.
adviser_deathrow_explain3               They'll use those raw materials to build the foundations and framework of your new building.
adviser_deathrow_explain4               This is the slowest part of construction, so you should plan ahead when building new facilities.
adviser_deathrow_explain5               While we wait, take a look around.  Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around, and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

objective_deathrow_building             Construct a building to house the Execution Facility

adviser_deathrow_buildinside1           We will also need an entrance to the new Execution Facility.
adviser_deathrow_buildinside2           Build a Large Jail Door into the south wall.

objective_deathrow_buildouterdoor       Build a Large Jail Door entrance

adviser_deathrow_internalwalls1          Inside the building I want a Cell and an Execution Room.
adviser_deathrow_internalwalls2          Partition the space by constructing some Brick Walls.

objective_deathrow_buildinternalwalls   Build internal walls

adviser_deathrow_internaldoors1          Now add Large Jail Doors to those dividing walls.
adviser_deathrow_internaldoors2          You can rotate an object before placement by clicking the middle mouse button (or press R).

objective_deathrow_buildinternaldoors   Build internal doors (Middle Click or press R to rotate an object)

adviser_deathrow_designation1           That's looking good.  We now need to designate Rooms within those spaces.
adviser_deathrow_designation2           Designate a Cell in the smaller area where our condemned inmate will live.
adviser_deathrow_designation3           Then designate the Execution Room itself in the larger area.

objective_deathrow_designatecell        Designate a Cell
objective_deathrow_designateexecution   Designate an Execution Room

adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements1      Those new Rooms have requirements before they become functional.
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements2      The Cell needs a Bed and a Toilet.
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements3      The Execution Room requires the Electric Chair.

objective_deathrow_cellobjects1         Build a Bed
objective_deathrow_cellobjects2         Build a Toilet
objective_deathrow_executionobjects     Build an Electric Chair

adviser_deathrow_optional1              That's the essentials taken care of.  But there are still a few improvements you could make.
adviser_deathrow_optional2              It's up to you though, these aren't strictly required.  It depends how much you care about your prisoners and their environment.
adviser_deathrow_optional3              The Cell itself could be improved with an outward facing Window, and a small Bookshelf.
adviser_deathrow_optional4              And the facility would look better with a higher quality floor material - like Wooden Floorboards or Mosaic Tiles.
adviser_deathrow_optional5              Outside you could add some lighting, and a paved pathway if you think it needs it.

adviser_deathrow_transfer05             This is the man in question, Edward Romsey.  A teacher once, would you believe.
adviser_deathrow_transfer06             It's not our place to decide if he deserves this.  The Law has made that decision.  We're just here to do a job.
adviser_deathrow_transfer1              Once you are satisfied the facility is ready, you can begin the Prisoner Transfer to his new cell.
adviser_deathrow_transfer2              Simply click on the polaroid in his cell to initiate the transfer.

objective_deathrow_path                 (OPTIONAL) Build a Path to the new facility
objective_deathrow_window               (OPTIONAL) Add a Window to the Cell
objective_deathrow_bookshelf            (OPTIONAL) Add a Bookshelf to the Cell
objective_deathrow_flooring             (OPTIONAL) Redo the flooring with higher quality materials
objective_deathrow_outerlights          (OPTIONAL) Create some outdoor lighting around the facility
objective_deathrow_transferinmate       When you are done, begin the Prisoner Transfer by clicking on the polaroid in Edward's cell.

adviser_deathrow_setupmurder1           Don't shed one tear for this guy.  He's a stone cold killer, guilty as charged.
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder2           He even confessed.  Wanna hear his description of what he did?
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder3           It's juicy stuff.  "It was around 11pm.  The lights were already on.  I knew she was home..."
adviser_deathrow_postmurder1            Like I said, a stone cold killer.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder2            Clear as day if you ask me.  Deserves every volt he's gonna get.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder3            All men deserve forgiveness, even him. Are you so sure in yourself that you can deal out such final judgement?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder4            Catching your wife with another man is no excuse for what he did.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder5            And he went there with a loaded gun, knowing he'd find them together. That's double pre-meditated murder.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder6            He's done nothing but co-operate with the authorities. This state is making an example of him.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder7            If he'd committed his crime 100 miles north he'd be looking at life imprisonment instead. How is that justice?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder8            Do you want a guy like this running free? I'll sleep just fine at night when I know he's gone.


adviser_deathrowelectricity_1           Good work so far.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_2           However there is one problem - the execution room isn't functioning yet, because it doesn't have any power.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_3           We need to connect it to the electrical supply.

adviser_deathrowelectricityb_1          We are now viewing the prison in Utilities mode, which shows us the electrical wiring layout for the entire prison.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_2          Each building in the prison is connected to the Power Grid by these thick underground electrical cables.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_3          Power is provided to the prison by this substation, which draws electricity from the national grid.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4          As you can see, this entire wing of prison cells is without power.  All of the lights are out.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4b         To fix this problem, we first need to switch into Utilities mode to understand why the lights are without power.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_5          The nearest electrical cables are too far away - our engineers can't complete the wiring for this area.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_6          Extend the electrical cables nearby to cover this wing of the prison.

objective_deathrow_cellpower            Connect the rooms to the Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_connectchair_1         Lights aren't the only thing that needs power.  Your new Electric Chair does too.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_2         Use the Power Cables to connect the execution facility to the power grid.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_3         The Electric Chair itself is a special type of electrical item.  It requires its own dedicated power line. You'll need to connect it up directly with mains cables.

objective_deathrow_chairpower           Connect the Electric Chair to the Electrical Supply
objective_deathrow_condemnedcellpower   Connect the Cell to the Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_testchair_1            We are almost done I think.  We should test the new Execution room at least once before we try to use it though.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_2            I'm just going to turn it on for a few seconds, make sure everything is ok.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_3            Well, that didn't work.  Looks like we drew too much power, and tripped a circuit breaker in the power station.  The whole prison is dark.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_4            We're going to need more juice to be able to handle the power spike that the electric chair generates.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5            First, we need to turn the power back on.   This is a two step process:
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5b           Switch the power station back on by clicking on it, and selecting Switch On in the menu that appears.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_6            Then build three more capacitors so we have enough Power Capacity to handle the electric chair.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_7            Once you've done that, test the Electric chair again by clicking on it and selecting Switch On in the menu.

objective_deathrow_poweron              Turn the Power Station back on. (Click the power station, then select Switch On from the menu)
objective_deathrow_expandpower          Expand the power station with three new Capacitors
objective_deathrow_chairworking         Test the chair again (click on it, and select Switch On)

adviser_deathrow_execution_1            Well done.  I believe we are finished with this job.
adviser_deathrow_execution_2            What happens now is out of our hands.  We did a professional job, and that's important in our business.
adviser_deathrow_execution_3            Try not to worry about what happens next.

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution1        It is time, Edward.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution2        You have done the right thing, even though this world will not forgive you for it.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution3        You will be with God soon, and He will have the final judgement on you.

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution4        Edward Romsey.  You have been found guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution5        The penalty is death.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution6        Do you have anything to say?
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution7        Susan...
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution8        I'm sorry.

event_bulkintake                        A disaster at a nearby prison has rendered a whole section of the facility unusable. We have no choice but to transfer the prisoners there to your prison, as there are no other suitable facilities nearby. They will be arriving soon.

event_virus_x                           We've been getting reports of sickness from a number of prisoners, and the symptoms seem quite severe. You should consider quarantining the sick and treating them before it spreads too far.
event_treefire                          A fire has started in our forestry!
event_foodpoisoning                     We've been getting reports of food poisoning amongst the prisoners. Some of the food in the kitchen must have spoiled. Unfortunately for the sick, there isn't much to do but to wait it out.
event_cilistleak                        We don't know how, but the identities of our confidential informants have got out. If we don't move them somewhere save straight away, they are going to be in real danger.
event_keysersoze                        A recent high-profile gang case has implicated one of our Minimum Security prisoners as a high ranking gang leader. They've remained under the radar, but now everyone knows who they are...
event_preacherconversion                One of our more charismatic inmates has become something of a religious evangelist, and others seem to be coming around to their way of thinking. Not a necessarily a problem, but our prisoners may soon have more spiritual needs.

event_massassassination_1               The identities of a number of witnesses in a federal prosecution case have been leaked, and some of them are inmates in our prison.
event_massassassination_2               Hits have been taken out on them, but we need them alive. You need to identify the prisoners and keep them in one piece until their court date comes up.
event_massassassination_3_x             We're learning about this late, so you don't have much time before these hits go live.

event_tvremovaldemand_1                 The media have started a campaign over the amenities granted to prisoners, and it's bringing a lot of heat on my office.
event_tvremovaldemand_2                 I'm passing a bill which bans TVs in common areas in prisons, so I need you to remove all TVs from your common rooms or you will be fined. You have 6 hours.
event_tvremovaldemand_fine              You've failed to remove TVs from your common rooms, which is now required by law. You've been fined, and will continue to receive fines until you comply.
event_tvremovaldemand_complete          The media have moved on to something else and the bill banning TVs from common areas has been repealed. Feel free to re-install them if you wish.

event_weightsremovaldemand_1            The media have started a campaign over the amenities granted to prisoners, and it's brining a lot of heat on my office.
event_weightsremovaldemand_2            I'm passing a bill which bans exercise equipment in prison yards, so I need you to remove all Weights Benches from your Yards or you will be fined. You have 6 hours.
event_weightsremovaldemand_fine         You've failed to remove all Weights Benches from your yards, which is now required by law. You've been fined, and will continue to receive fines until you comply.
event_weightsremovaldemand_complete     The media have moved on to something else and the bill banning weights benches from yards has been repealed. Feel free to re-install them if you wish.

event_lessfooddemand_1                  The board has decided to experiment with a number of cost-saving measures across our facilities, and your prison is being included.
event_lessfooddemand_2                  We need you to reduce the meal quantity and meal variation policies in your prison to low, so we can see what effect this has on overall budgets.
event_lessfooddemand_fine               Since you've decided not to implement the new food policies we've asked for, we're going to take the potential savings directly from your funds. This will continue to happen until you do as I've asked.
event_lessfooddemand_complete           The food budget experiment is over and the results are inconclusive. You are free to set your food policies back to whatever you wish.

event_removevisitationdemand_1          An incident at another facility has highlighted potential issues with security checks when it comes to family visitation in prisons.
event_removevisitationdemand_2          Until the processes can be properly reviewed, all visitation must be suspended. You have 12 hours to remove all Visitation rooms from your prison.
event_removevisitationdemand_fine       You have failed to remove the Visitation rooms from your prison, despite the current security issues. You've been fined, and will continue to be fined until you comply.
event_removevisitationdemand_complete   We've completed our security review of the visitation process, and Visitation rooms can now be re-added to your prison if you choose.

event_lessworkdemand_1                  I've just received word that the prisoners are unhappy with how much time they have to work during the day, and are planning to cause trouble if it isn't reduced.
event_lessworkdemand_2                  A guard overheard someone say that if they had to work for more than 2 hours they were going to "tear this place apart."
event_lessworkdemand_ignore             It looks like the prisoners have given up and settled down. They aren't happy about it, but it's good to show them who's boss around here.
event_lessworkdemand_complete           The prisoners have settled down about their work hours now - I guess they saw the last few days as something of a vacation. We can put them back to work without trouble.

event_moresleepdemand_1                 We've received complaints that the prisoners aren't allowed to sleep enough, and are getting very irritable about it.
event_moresleepdemand_2                 They've said that if they aren't given at least 7 hours of sleep a night, they are going to start causing trouble.
event_moresleepdemand_ignore            Looks like the prisoners have finally run out of steam and given up their protests about lack of sleep. Guess they were too tired.
event_moresleepdemand_complete          The whole issue with the prisoners' sleep schedules has finally blown over, so you can change them again without issue if you want.

event_morefreetimedemand_1              The prisoners are apparently unhappy with how little freetime they have in their daily schedules.
event_morefreetimedemand_2              The guards have been hearing whispers that if things don't change soon, the prisoners are going to start causing some damage.
event_morefreetimedemand_ignore         The prisoners have settled down and stopped causing trouble over their lack of freetime. Maybe they realised they'd have even less if they are always in solitary.
event_morefreetimedemand_complete       The prisoners demands for more freetime have been indulged for long enough, so you can feel free to change their schedule again as you wish.

event_contrabandsurge_complete          We've just discovered that one of the teachers we bring in for the inmates classes has been smuggling in huge amounts of contraband. They've been fired, but the damage has been done at this point.
event_corruptingspiritualist_complete	One of the spiritual leaders we bring in for our religious programs has been riling up the inmates with all kinds of hateful speech. They've been fired, but the prisoners will take some time to cool down.

event_agitatingradio_1                  According to some of our Guards, a new radio host on the station the prisoners listen to has been saying a lot of things that are riling a the inmates up.
event_agitatingradio_2                  It might be worth removing the radios for the time being, unless they start to take what he's saying seriously.
event_agitatingradio_complete           That radio host was apparently fired after a lot of complaints. There shouldn't be any more problems with radios in the prison.
