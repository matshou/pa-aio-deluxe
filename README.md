# Prison Architect - All in One Deluxe Edition 

This project is a fork of a [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=830937667) mod created by [GrandSong](https://steamcommunity.com/id/grandsong). It contains my own code contributions (see project <code>[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/yooksi/pa-aio-deluxe/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)</code> for more information) and improved project documentation.

## Motivation

This fork was created in hopes of improving the mod and making it easier for users and other developers to see relevant game changes introduced by this mod.

## Summary

This mod is a result of great effort to enhance the game to the fullest. 

- All good mods on the Workshop are not only integrated but also significantly improved or largely remade.
- You will not need any other Workshop mods (with very few exceptions).
- Contains unique features which will meet your wishes or go beyond your imagination.

## Features

- More then 500 hours of hard work.
- Nearly 10,000 lines of Lua script code.
- Corrections to many mistakes and errors in texts, images and configurations.
- A lot of helpful information provided through tooltips, revealing many mysteries and making you no longer have to guess blindly or be misled by rumours found around forums.
- Redesigned User Interface:
  - Modified the layouts and elements of dialogues (especially Main Menu, Reports and Rapsheet tabs).
  - Room and need complaint icons are now in a modern style.
- Many tweaks to materials, objects, grants and need providers making the game more realistic, more reasonable and most important of all, more balanced.
- New tools, items, staff and mechanics.

## Installation

### Versions

- Full Deluxe edition is available on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=830937667) or [Github](https://github.com/yooksi/pa-aio-deluxe/releases/latest).
- If your PC runs slowly with full Deluxe edition, use [the Lite version](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834342553).
- If you are Chinese, use [{中文豪华版}](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=821415114).

### Instructions

- Subscribe to the mod on Steam Workshop or download the latest release from Github.
- Enable the mod in-game by navigating to `Main Menu > Extras > Mods` and ticking the checkbox located to the right side of the mod entry, then clicking apply.
- If you are downloading from the Workshop and don't see this mod in the list, wait for it to download (Steam downloader will be working in the background) and try later.

## Useful tips

- Consider playing the Hitman: Agent 48 mini games where you control a hitman to assassinate or rescue a target prisoner. Note that you need to research and hire the hitman before you can use this feature.
- If you feel bored by a successful yet peaceful prison, try the reform program *Dangerous Meeting* and the *Guard Corruption* mechanic to irritate prisoners and cause fights. 

## Warning

This mod might cause crashes (I am not sure if, when and why). **Save often!**

## Mods borrowed

- [Helvetica Neue Font](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=596594446)
	- A classic and neutral font.

- [Stylized icons](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484196510)
	- Very good style but I had to replace half of the icons, redesigned colors and improve some subtle details.

- [Clearer Needs Icons](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=208679449) 
	- Replaced and added a few icons.

- [Better Clock Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=479040269) 
	- Due to limitations, the fastest speed is 10 times.
	- Unicode characters were used to replace the ugly ones.

## Mods not included

This is a list of mods that I decided not to integrate. Don't misunderstand me, the mods listed in this section are good, but I just don't think it is necessary to integrate them. You can however try them independently.

- [Table Bench & Ironboard smaler than the original](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=516250875)
  - If you like a tiny prison, this can save some space for you. 
  - It is not very realistic and can break existing maps (prisons).

- [Disable Sheet Metal](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=521488103)
  - Still not perfect. so it would be better to invest in Bookkeeping if you don't like Workshop product lines.

- [Read Mails](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=762749999)
  - Quite creative and very interesting, but only for a short time until you explored all its content.

- [Real-time Basketball](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693956799)
  - Very creative and fun.
  - The author *"murgh"* has made many great mods. Don't forget to take a look and try.

- [Customizable Control Booths](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687910616)
  - Very creative, but very complicated too.

- [Simple Garden Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434985481)
  - Lovely and quite realistic.

### Inspiration

Here is a list of mods that inspired me:

- [Separator Room](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=378010905)

- [Various Modification Pack](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612709803)

- [Workshop Requirements](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=584972698)

- [PowerSwitch PipeValve and DoorTimer on Walls](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624145202)

- [Additional Doors](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=461879768)
	- I made my own three-meter jail door.

- [A lot of new names! Only Names.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=436622291)
	- Because the regular prisoners (not from `names_in_the_game.bin`) have the same forenames and surnames over and over again, more variety was needed. Names comes from many different countries while English names are still the majority.[^1]

- [A lot of new skins! Only Normal skins.](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448807272)
	- Improves and adds prisoner skin colors (especially, pink, yellow and black are better than vanilla).[^2]
